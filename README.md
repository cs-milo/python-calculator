# Basic Python Calculator

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator written in Python. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and then choose an operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide). The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result.

The goal of this project was to practice working with user input, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## How It Works
- The user enters two numbers.
- The user selects an operation by typing ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, or DIVIDE.
- The program evaluates the choice using conditional statements.
- The calculated result is displayed in a readable format.
- If an invalid operation is entered, the program displays an error message.

## What I Learned
This project helped reinforce the following concepts:

- Converting user input into integers
- Using `if / elif / else` statements to control program flow
- Handling user input with basic validation
- Using string methods like `.upper()` to make input comparisons more flexible
- Writing clear output statements for command-line programs

This project also highlighted the importance of accounting for user input errors.
As part of my college coursework, this project (and class) made it very apparent how useful coding can be, and how I could actually use it to make my time
in college much easier.
